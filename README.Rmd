**DecelR** is an R package for sport scientists to analyze
deceleration and change-of-direction (COD) performance from
time–speed data, the 
Acceleration-to-Deceleration Assessment (ADA).

The package derives acceleration directly from filtered speed-time
data (dv/dt), avoiding reliance on device-reported acceleration.
