Description: Tools for analyzing horizontal deceleration performance in sport and
    human movement data. The package provides methods for filtering time-series
    velocity data, identifying deceleration phase boundaries using peak velocity
    or acceleration-based thresholds, computing key performance metrics, and
    visualizing speed-time and speed-position curves. A Shiny application is
    included for interactive data exploration. Currently, the package works best
    for acceleration to deceleration assessments. In the future, we hope to add
    other assessments such as those including a reacceleration following a
    directional change.
